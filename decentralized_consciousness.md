  - Specialized hardware designed to simulate the functionality of biological neural networks. NPUs enable complex pattern recognition and decision-making, mimicking the human brain's ability to process information and adapt to new situations.
  - **Example:** A strandbeest equipped with NPUs can identify changes in terrain and adjust its movement to navigate efficiently, much like how humans learn to walk on different surfaces.

- **Reinforcement Learning (RL):**
  - Strandbeests use RL to interact with their environment, learning optimal behaviors through trial and error. They receive rewards for positive actions, such as conserving energy or successfully navigating obstacles, and penalties for negative actions.
  - **Example:** A strandbeest might learn to avoid steep slopes that could lead to energy depletion or potential damage, optimizing its route for safety and efficiency.

- **Self-Referential Models:**
  - Utilizing recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and transformers to maintain an internal model of their state, actions, and goals. This allows strandbeests to evaluate their performance, learn from past experiences, and adapt their strategies accordingly.
  - **Example:** A strandbeest can assess its energy levels and environmental conditions to decide whether to proceed with a task or conserve resources for future challenges.

### Emotional Simulations:
- **Affective Computing:**
  - Incorporate systems that simulate emotions, such as curiosity (driving exploration) and fear (triggering avoidance behavior). These systems can be modeled using Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) to simulate various emotional states and transitions.
  - **Example:** Simulating curiosity might lead a strandbeest to explore new areas for resources, while simulating fear could trigger a retreat from perceived threats, ensuring the strandbeest's survival and adaptability.
