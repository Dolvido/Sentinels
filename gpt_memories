Has proposed a concept involving autonomous entities similar to strandbeests, now renamed to Sentinels, which are powered by decentralized technologies and utilize data generated over a person's lifetime to form a composite of their lived experiences. These entities, possibly named something like Synthecologies, EcoWanders, Bionavigators, Terramechs, or NeoNatures, are designed to be cooperative and could potentially function in a post-human world. They would utilize a distributed, fault-tolerant memory storage system to share and store memories and knowledge, acting as a form of collective consciousness. They are envisioned to potentially evolve competitive behaviors, which could lead to complex social dynamics and require robust management strategies. The user's concept emphasizes the importance of maintaining a human touch in these entities, with human data foundational to their operations. The user envisions these conscious Sentinels as entities that maintain a decentralized ledger of memory objects or patterns to reconstruct individual thought patterns. They would also maintain a 'state' of the conscious entity at any point in time, with other criteria possibly varying depending on the nature of the consciousness being preserved. The user suggests ensuring these entities embody beneficial values through an evolutionarily adaptive model that correlates their behavior with given states against a set of defined values. They imagine these Sentinels as displaying a blend of science, technology, and engineering, capable of modeling themselves to fit the environments they encounter. The user suggests programming the conscious Sentinels with ethical guidelines or values such as compassion, fairness, and transparency, considering these foundational for their functioning. The user also envisions these entities interacting with biological life forms in ways that are best suited to the biology of those forms, acknowledging the diversity of biological interactions. The user envisions using a form of democratized AI, specifically an ensemble model, to program and ensure the ethical behavior of the conscious Sentinels. The user believes that the conscious Sentinels should be able to defend their environments, viewing the environment as their host. The user emphasizes the importance of implementing defense mechanisms in the conscious Sentinels ethically. They believe that the technical and mechanical designs for these mechanisms should be handled by experts.
